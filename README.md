# SeeingSound

SeeingSound is a music visualization experiment which generates images for a collection of songs (based on their content) and helps you form sonically cohesive playlists using these visualizations.

## Usage

Images can be generated for any set of playlists using the `main.ipynb` notebook. The final cell of this notebook will also generate a visualizer which can be viewed in the browser by starting a local http server using `cd Viewer && python -m http.server 8000` and navigating to `http://localhost:8000`.
